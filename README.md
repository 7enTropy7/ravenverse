The foundation for any Machine Learning or Deep Learning Framework. Simply put, it is more like a decentralized calculator, comparable to a decentralized version of the IBM machines that were used to launch the Apollo astronauts. Apart from building ML/DL frameworks, a lot more can be done on it, such as maximizing yield on your favorite DeFi protocols like Compound and more!
