# Contribute to Raven Distribution Framework

### 1. Open an issue
We recommend opening an issue (if one doesn't already exist) and discussing your intended changes before making any changes. We'll be able to provide you feedback and confirm the planned modifications this way.

### 2. Make code changes
To make modifications to the code, you must fork the repository. You'll need to set up a development environment before setting up the RDF. The RDF can be set up as detailed in the [README.md](README.md)

### 3. Create a pull request
Once the change is complete, submit a pull request to the master branch from your fork's branch.

### 4. Merging
We will review the code changes and merge the pull request.
